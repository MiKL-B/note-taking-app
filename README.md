# Information
This app is under development.

# Description
Taking inspiration from note-taking apps like Inkdrop, Bear, Obsidian, Notable, and Evernote, I decided to create my own app.

My goal was to design a tool that was tailored to my needs without having to spend money on existing solutions.
This project also offers me the opportunity to improve my development skills.

It is essential whether it is for my technology watch or for simple note-taking.
